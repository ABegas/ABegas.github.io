                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p class="u-font-primary-bold">
                    Shoparize, originally Kiesproduct, was founded in 2013 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Shoparize’s growth was fueled by shifting purchasing trends and confidence in consuming spending. This was when Shoparize learned best practices and grew within these experiences to the observed success today. The level of expertise in ad campaign optimization, feed optimization and campaign management were all developed as the industry sector matured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running successful campaigns is our number one priority, however, finding ways to help our customers by engaging in their success became our differentiator as a Comparison Shopping Service. Our attention to detail, superior customer support and innovative technology is what has set us apart from the rest.
                </p>

                    Shoparize accounts for 23% of the Benelux region’s market share, and we are competitive throughout the 21 European Union member countries. We are only scratching the surface when it comes to our knowledge gain and hunger to grow the e-commerce market throughout Europe.

                <p>
                    Expanding our suite of product offerings only continues to increase and sets us apart. The 2017 court ruling regarding Google’s monopolistic practices seen throughout the EU gave Shoparize a platform to rise above the standard industry sales proposition leading to superior customer service for our merchants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our responsibility to our customers and partners is ever present.

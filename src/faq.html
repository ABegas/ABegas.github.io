                <p>If you <a href="#">want to place</a> bids inside a Shopping campaign’s ad group, you do this using product groups inside your inventory. You will notice that when you first create a Shopping campaign, you only have one ad containing one product group called “All products”. Your entire inventory resides in “All products”. If you want to make bidding more specific to your advertising goals, you can divide your inventory into smaller groups with subdivisions.</p>
                <p>For each product group, you can subdivide up to 7 levels. It is possible to bid the same amount for all products if you have a product group containing all your products. If you want to bid on products organized by brand or product category, you can create smaller product groups. Note that you can only set bids on product groups you did not subdivide.</p>
                <p>You can subdivide a product group by signing in to your Google Ads account and navigating to the campaign that contains the product group(s) you want to edit. Then, select the ad group that includes the product group you wish to edit. Navigate to Product groups in the page menu. You are now on the product groups page.</p>
                <p>There are several Google Ads bid strategies. First, you can choose between manual or automated bid strategies. Depending on your goals, you can choose the bidding strategy that works best for you. These are some of the bidding strategies you can choose from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual CPC Bidding (set a maximum price on the cost per click)</li>
                    <li>Enhanced Cost Per Click (ECPC) (automatically adapts your manual bids for clicks that seem more or less prone to lead to a conversion or sale)</li>
                    <li>Target CPA (Cost per Acquisition) (Smart bidding strategy that helps get as many conversions as possible at or below the CPA you set)</li>
                    <li>Target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) (helps you get more revenue or conversion value at the target ROAS you set. Target ROAS is only available on adgroup level)</li>
                    <li>Maximize conversion (automatically sets bids to get you the most conversions for your campaign while spending your budget)</li>

                <p>You can subdivide a product group by signing in to your Google Ads account and navigating to the campaign that contains the product group(s) you want to edit. Then, select the ad group that includes the product group you wish to edit. Navigate to Product groups in the page menu. You are now on the product groups page.</p>
                <p>There are several Google Ads bid strategies. First, you can choose between manual or automated bid strategies. Depending on your goals, you can choose the bidding strategy that works best for you. These are some of the bidding strategies you can choose from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual CPC Bidding (set a maximum price on the cost per click)</li>
                    <li>Enhanced Cost Per Click (ECPC) (automatically adapts your manual bids for clicks that seem more or less prone to lead to a conversion or sale)</li>
                    <li>Target CPA (Cost per Acquisition) (Smart bidding strategy that helps get as many conversions as possible at or below the CPA you set)</li>
                    <li>Target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) (helps you get more revenue or conversion value at the target ROAS you set. Target ROAS is only available on adgroup level)</li>
                    <li>Maximize conversion (automatically sets bids to get you the most conversions for your campaign while spending your budget)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you <a href="#">want to place</a> bids inside a Shopping campaign’s ad group, you do this using product groups inside your inventory. You will notice that when you first create a Shopping campaign, you only have one ad containing one product group called “All products”. Your entire inventory resides in “All products”. If you want to make bidding more specific to your advertising goals, you can divide your inventory into smaller groups with subdivisions.</p>
                <p>For each product group, you can subdivide up to 7 levels. It is possible to bid the same amount for all products if you have a product group containing all your products. If you want to bid on products organized by brand or product category, you can create smaller product groups. Note that you can only set bids on product groups you did not subdivide.</p>
